Version 0.1-20
=============

NEW FEATURES

- lognormb distribution: a lognormal distribution with arithmetic mean and sd parametrization. 
- Pert and triangular distribution as an alternative parametrization using the mean 

Version 0.1-18
=============

BUG FIX

- potential bugs linked to the default limit of 60 characters in the deparse function. Let to errors in hist, plot, converg, ... 

Version 0.1-17
=============

BUG FIX

- one bug in rtriang, rpert, rbetagen corrected (error when the length of the arguments differed)

Version 0.1-16
=============

BUG FIX

- one bug in rtriang corrected (returned 1 when min == mode == max)
- one error in the manual was corrected

Version 0.1-15
=============

BUG FIX

- one bug in mcstoc for multivariates nodes with truncation was corrected

Version 0.1-14
=============

BUG FIX

- one bug for multivariates nodes with truncation was corrected
- addition of tests for truncations (function rtrunc and mcstoc (option trunc=TRUE)). Some unexpected results linked to rounding errors could be obtained for some extreme truncations (see examples). Note that it is not possible to catch all errors and a warning is now provided in the documentation.

IMPROVEMENTS

- pert is definitively better and quicker.
- the vignettes were revised

Version 0.1-13
=============

BUG FIX

- pert, betagen and triang functions were slow in previous versions. This is fixed 
- some of the rdist functions returned matrixes when some of the arguments were matrixes
- all parameters but the first one are now vectorized in the univariate p, d, q, r distribution functions

Version 0.1-12
=============

BUG FIX

- a bug in the definition of d2V and d3V in the mc2dLmEnglish vignette
- a bug in dmultinomial with log = FALSE: it led to NA values

NEW FEATURES

- creation of a NAMESPACE for R.2.14 compliance 
- additionnal xlim and ylim arguments in plot.mc

Version 0.1-11
=============

BUG FIX

- rtriang was really slow in Version 0.1-10

Version 0.1-10
=============

NEW FEATURES

- dempiricalC is now vectorized and improved
- better control of limit cases in distributions

BUG FIXES

- major correction: dbetagen and dpert led to wrong values
- major correction: mcapply led to incorrect results when the function returned a vector of length n and if margin was 'unc' or 'variates'
- one bug in extractvar led to errors

Version 0.1-9
=============

NEW FEATURES

- dmultinormal, a vectorized version of dmvnorm

IMPROVEMENTS

- all p- d- q- r-distributions return numeric(0) if the first argument (x, q, p or n) are numeric(0)  

BUG FIXES

- dmultinomial led to errors

Version 0.1-8
=============

NEW FEATURES

- pmin.mcnode and pmax.mcnode 
- a second vignette

IMPROVEMENTS

- error message in mc when one argument was neither an mc nor an mcnode

BUG FIXES

- rempiricalC and qempiricalC lead to errors 

Version 0.1-7
=============

NEW FEATURES

- The documentation is now a real vignette
- mcratio, a function to measure variability and uncertainty
- extractvar and addvar, two utilities for multivariate nodes

IMPROVEMENTS

- Ops.mcnode function is much more efficient and less memory consuming
- great improvement for speed in mcstoc for multivariate distributions
- plot.mc proposes to fill the enveloppes
- empiricalD is (a little bit) more efficient

BUG FIXES

- lhs: could bug when sent without default distribution. Now, distr="runif" by default.
- lhs: nsv = ndvar() and nsu = ndunc() by default
- mcstoc: issue when rtrunc with linf or lsup as multivariate nodes: solved
- rtrunc: issue for discrete distribution. It is now clear that rtrunc sample within (linf, lsup]. As a consequence, linf should be strictly lower than lsup
- same issue in mcstoc

Version 0.1-6
=============


BUG FIXES

- Pert distribution: could bug when is.equal(mu,mode) while mu!=mode.
- mcprobtree: allows now to use mcvalues with a type different of
  the type of the ouptut


Version 0.1-5
=============


- Initial release on CRAN.
