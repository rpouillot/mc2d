# Tools for Two-Dimensional Monte-Carlo Simulations

## The package 

`mc2d` provides a complete framework to build and study Two-Dimensional Monte-Carlo simulations, aka Second-Order Monte-Carlo simulations. It also includes various distributions frequently used in the risk assessment domain (pert, triangular, Bernoulli, empirical discrete and continuous, beta subjective, 
Minimum Quantile Information Distribution, ...).



## Getting it

The stable version of `mc2d` can be installed from CRAN using:
```r
install.packages("mc2d")
library("mc2d")
```

The development version of `mc2d` can be installed from GitHub (`devtools` needed):

```r
if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE))
   install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ericcheny/mc2d-update")
library("mc2d")
```
